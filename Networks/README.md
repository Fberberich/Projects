Here are some example labs that I have completed and helped students with as a Networking lab assisstant.

The files found in this repository I created from Cisco Packet Tracer.

They each cover configuring static routing across 4 routers that connects multiple networks. One file uses IPv6 for its static routes and the other uses IPv4.  

There's another file that covers configuring OSPFv2 using IPv4 across 4 routers that allows the different networks to communicate with each other.
