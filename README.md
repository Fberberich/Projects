This is a repository where I hold some of my previous coding projects that I worked on when I was an underclassman at Marist College. 

The "Limbo" folder contains files from when I took Software Development II and created a Website and a database. I linked the two together using PHP, and the site is fully interactive. I've gotten way better at web development, so please feel free to check out my Portfolio website, which I coded entirely from scratch. 

There are some other files in this repository that I coded when I took Intro to Coding and Software Development I, but I highly recommend checking out my portfolio website as it has WAY more projects that I've worked on over the years and overall just shows what I can do.
