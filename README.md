This is a repository where I upload some of my previous projects that I've worked on over the past couple of years. 

The "Networks" folder contains files from Cisco Packet Tracer that I created when I was a lab assistant tutoring students in a Class called Internetwork taught at Marist College.

The "Limbo" folder contains files from when I took Software Development II and created a Website and a database. I linked the two together using PHP and the site is interactive. I've gotten way better at so please feel free to check out my Portfolio website that I coded entirely from scratch. 

There are some other files in this repository that I coded when I took Intro to Coding and Software Development I, but I highly recommend checking out my portfolio website as it has WAY more projects that I've worked on over the years.
