This is a "Website" that I created that is runned off of Abyss Web Server, MAMP, or any other application that can run php and html off of localhost.

I created it when practicing using PHP and SQL 

The site is called Limbo and allows users to look or report lost/found items. It uses a SQL database that is also attatched to keep track of lost and found items.

To properly run this application, copy and paste the files into the main folder of localhost server and source the sql before running. 

The SQL file also creates an admin with the placeholder username and password as "admin","admin". You can use it to sign into the Admin's page on the site.
